import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('credit_card_transactions.csv')

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df.drop('is_fraud', axis=1), df['is_fraud'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=df['is_fraud'])
Next, we can train a logistic regression model on the dataset:

# Train a logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model on the testing set
accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print("Accuracy: {:.2f}%".format(accuracy * 100))
